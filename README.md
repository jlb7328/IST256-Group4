# IST256-Group4
IST256 group project which requires a fully functioning webpage that is used for shopping.


Submission 1:
  Submission 1 included the bulk of the work to set up a platform from scratch to run a website on, along with some basic functionality. A lot of reasearch was done but it has most defintely been a learning experience for everyone.
Lots of html, java, and json files were created and experimented with to ensure success.

Submission 2:
  Submission 2 included changing a lot of rough draft work from submission 1 and making it more presentable as well as ensuring that more design choices were similarized to make the website as a whole feel cohesive. Sample products were created and added to a json file that a simple api can use to transfer anything in this file to the website. That way, instead of it being hard coded, any changes will automatically be reflected in the website. A search bar was also added to better help users shop, should the list of products be expanded on and be too large of a list to reasonably scroll through in order to find what the user is looking for.

Submission 3:
  Submission 3 included a checkout page that utilizes an interactive interface from the previous submission and allows the user to have any selections made be automatically taken to the checkout page. This allows the website to feel smooth and streamlined, while keeping the feel that every other page has. Many hours went into ensuring this functioned properly and any additions to it later needed to be made carefully added to ensure nothing breaks. Afterwords, cleaning up this page so that it was readable from a code standpoint was done, and the temporary checkout page on the nav bar was removed with the addition of a proper checkout button that tracks how many items are kept inside of it.

Submission 4:
  Subm  ssion 4 included a new checkout page that actually facilitates checkout and shipping as well. Main changes of note include the new checkout.html page, and the new orders.json page. While not exactly perfect, it does as indended and functions as needed. Only notable issue is the download of the orders document rather than the change of an already existing one.
